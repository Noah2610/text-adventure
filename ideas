		- everything is an experiment on a human,
			how far they get with the puzzles
		- end goal:
			find correct command and translation for it and input it into the command console (?)
				as soon as this happens you blackout again and wake-up either whilst receiving the babelfish inspired translator
				or after having received and applied it.
				the aliens can then explain to you that everything was an experiment (through dialogue)
		- could be a good tutorial sequence, aliens could help you if you're having problems with something for a longer period of time
		- possibility of finding clues for player to process on their own that reveal that this is only an experiment (leads to player fealing smart when it is confirmed)
		- something like a "staff-only" room where you are being monitored from
			- as a clue could be somehow seen without entering it
		- aliens could talk in a caesar or rot13 encrypted english language
			(because they are so advanced it's no problem for them, and player would feel very smart if they find out)
			- could easily hide eastereggs in command console with that idea: generic commands or words entered in proper encryption could result in some fun text

		- MAYBE: instead of having a babelfish like translation device, aliens speak english but during experiment act like they don't
			- could lead to unlockable skills of learning new languages for other planets and species

		puzzle ideas:
			- find power cable to turn on command console
			- find command to enter into it (ex. "land earth")
				- find "land" command
				- find "earth" planet name
					both either in alien symbols and decypher it later when player finds translation sheet
					(or player finds translations for both of these words)
			- find paper (and pen) and use with window to draw symbol parsley did while driving

		areas:
			spaceship  - entrance room
			bridge     - room with command console in it (for end goal)
			staff room - room from which player is monitored
			window     - see symbol in cornfield clearly from above
			(
			lounge     - ???
			closet     - find power cable in it
			)

	GENERAL {

		- hide eastereggs in form of encrypted messages (easiest for users to find: caesar, rot13, vigenere with some key that has been emphasized)
		- idea for giving users clues:
			generate files in game or saves directory if user has a problem with a mission for a longer period
