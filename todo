(change area stuff similar to items)

area:
	items in objects or environment

x class Person
	- VERBS
		x - talk
		- give ITEM (works when talking to person)
		x - look (at)

REFACTOR:
	inventory and general item storage system:
		only store the Object itself in inventory,
		instead of that weird array inclduing an array of symbols
		find different solution for Instance items, those should still be symbols

create system for storing conversational text (tied to methods in Person objects)
in files (shouldn't be too difficult if i follow my desc text storing system)
