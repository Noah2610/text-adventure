REFACTOR:
	inventory and general item storage system:
		only store the Object itself in inventory,
		instead of that weird array inclduing an array of symbols
		find different solution for Instance items, those should still be symbols

x create system for storing conversational text (tied to methods in Person objects)
x in files (shouldn't be too difficult if i follow my desc text storing system)

add tests (with guard or something)

encrypt savefile (to prohibit arbitrary code execution somewhat, because of eval())

don't create all instances (aside from items) at start of game
this makes savefile large from the start
